The MVD Checker is a generic tool for verifying IFC models. The validation rules are defined in the mvdXML schema. The software produces a BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) report that can be used in BIM tools like Solibri to review the viewpoints and the comment of the validation issues.

- 13 December 2021: Security patch added for the web interface.

Version 1.1 Final. 15. 02. 2016


Supported mvdXML versions are v1.1. v1-1 and v1.2 draft 3.

Precompiled binaries that can be used at a web application server can be found here: 
https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/OnlineMvdXMLChecker/releases

Tomcat 9 (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) was used as an application server for the tests.


This code is based on the original work of Chi Zhang in:

The test Open API interface can be found here:
http://lbd.arch.rwth-aachen.de/mvdXMLChecker/apidocs/

It is recommended to use OpenJDK 21 (it is the modt current  Long-Term Support version). Java 17 is supported. OpenJava can be downloaded from  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download).
On a Windows system, download the MSI file that matches your processor type (usually x64 aka Intell), and run it to install Java.


## A Sample Python client source

Python 3.8.  Needed modules: requests
```
import requests
import json
from pathlib import Path

ifc_file_path = 'C:/test/Duplex_A_20110505.ifc'
mvdxml_file_path = 'C:/test/Simple.mvdxml'

ifc_file = open(ifc_file_path, 'rb')
mvdxml_file = open(mvdxml_file_path, 'rb')

files = {"ifcFile": (ifc_file_path, ifc_file),"mvdXMLfile": (mvdxml_file_path, mvdxml_file)}
headers={}

resp = requests.post("http://lbd.arch.rwth-aachen.de/mvdXMLChecker/api/check_plain", files=files, headers=headers )
print(resp.text)
print("status code " + str(resp.status_code))

if resp.status_code == 200:
    print ("Success")
    data = json.loads(resp.text)
else:
    print ("Failure")
```

```
import requests
from pathlib import Path

ifc_file_path = 'c:\\temp\\A.ifc'
mvdxml_file_path = 'c:\\temp\\A.mvdxml'

ifc_file = open(ifc_file_path, 'rb')
mvdxml_file = open(mvdxml_file_path, 'rb')

files = {"ifcFile": (ifc_file_path, ifc_file),"mvdXMLfile": (mvdxml_file_path, mvdxml_file)}
headers={}
resp = requests.post("http://lbd.arch.rwth-aachen.de/mvdXMLChecker/api/check", files=files, headers=headers )
print("status code " + str(resp.status_code))

if resp.status_code == 200:
    print ("Success")
    bcf_file = open("c:\\temp\\results.bcfzip", "wb")
    bcf_file.write(bytearray(resp.content))
    bcf_file.close()
else:
    print ("Failure")
